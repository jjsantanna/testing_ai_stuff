# AI stuff
This is just a long list of AI stuff/things/app that I've tested and I would like to remember.


## Playgroung environment
- https://ollama.com/ **Local App**
- https://console.groq.com/ **Cloud**
  - In short, Groq console is playground to test popular LLM models. I've tested 'deepseek-v1-distill-llama-70b' on 30/01/25. There is the 'chat' and the 'studio' mode. You can easily copy the python code to reproduce it. In one of my tests this was the stats: 27 input tokens; 1492 output tokens; 1519 total tokens; inference time: 0 input seconds and 5,43 output seconds; tokens/second: 6477 input; 275 output; total 280; round trip 5,9s.
- https://ai.azure.com/ **Cloud**
  - This is the Azure OpenAI Service. In my point of view, this is the best (private) way to use OpenAI LLM. It is under Microsoft terms of service (instead of OpenAI's). Most of my applications developed in 2023 and 2024 were using models from this.
